# Active Tracker (Succinct)

**Last updated:** 2025-12-30

This repo is in rolling mode. This file tracks the **highest-priority active work** in execution order.

Rules for this tracker:

- Keep it **succinct and actionable** (aim: 10–20 items total).
- This is **not** a changelog; implemented feature status belongs in:
  - `docs/LANGUAGE_FEATURE_MATRIX.md`
  - `docs/LANGUAGE_STATUS_AND_GAPS.md`
  - dedicated design docs under `docs/`
- When an item is “done enough” (rolling), move details to `docs/TODOS_ARCHIVE.md` and keep this file focused on what’s next.

## P0 (Now)

1) **Tier‑1 native support parity (arm64 + x86_64; macOS/Linux/Windows)** (L)
   - Converge the native backends on one semantics set:
     - callables (function values), closures, varargs/spread, and deterministic failure modes (`OREN_DIAG` + stack traces)
     - container ops (list/map/buf) with identical semantics across arch/OS
   - Keep validation integration-first, and keep the remote x64 path as a hard gate:
     - `docs/REMOTE_X64_ENV.md` (Win11 + WSL2)

2) **Native value tagging (remove “key kind inference” fragility)** (L)
   - Goal: **maps do not require explicit key kind** in the language model; the runtime can safely decide based on tagged values.
   - Interim (done, keep): native runtime infers map key kind using tracking metadata (`oren_find_node(...).kind == STRING`), and native codegen ensures string literals / member keys are tracked via `oren_ensure_tracked`.
   - Deliverable: a native value representation that can distinguish:
     - immediates (ints/bools/nil) vs pointers
     - string/list/map/buf payload kinds
   - References:
     - `docs/NATIVE_TAGGED_VALUE_REPRESENTATION.md`
     - `docs/DESIGN_CONTAINER_OPS.md`

3) **Backend architecture unification (CoreIR boundary)** (L)
   - Make one canonical CoreIR own semantics (eval order, short-circuit, varargs packing, closure ABI).
   - Backends become thin adapters (ABI + emit).
   - References:
     - `docs/BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
     - `docs/IR_AND_COMPILER_INTERNALS.md`

4) **Container ops as operations (no hot-path stdlib overhead)** (M)
   - Ensure `xs[i]`, `xs[i]=v`, `len`, `push` lower to intrinsics where appropriate.
   - Make map/list/buf iteration semantics deterministic across backends (add a unified iterator protocol so `for x in buf` works identically on arm64/x86_64 and across native/C/AVM).
   - Reference:
     - `docs/DESIGN_CONTAINER_OPS.md`
     - `docs/STDLIB_LAYERS.md`

5) **AVM in AVM + compiler-in-AVM (deterministic toolchain in a capsule)** (M)
   - Make `.oren → .obc` compilation runnable inside AVM with budgets and locked capability surfaces.
   - References:
     - `docs/AVM_MULTIVERSE.md`
     - `docs/AVM_SPEC_V1.md`
     - `docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`

6) **Stdlib distribution + module resolution (native + AVM)** (M)
   - One coherent story for end users:
     - `import ... "std:foo"` resolution
     - source vs precompiled stdlib bundles
     - AVM consuming the same stdlib without host-FS assumptions
   - References:
     - `docs/STDLIB_RESOLUTION_AND_DISTRIBUTION.md`
     - `docs/OBC_MODULE_LINKING.md`

7) **HPC/SIMD parity (arm64 NEON today; x86_64 SSE2/AVX next)** (M)
   - Keep determinism contract: scalar is authoritative; SIMD must be bit-identical for covered kernels.
   - Expand x86_64 SIMD coverage once x64 native reaches semantic parity.
   - References:
     - `docs/HPC_SERVER_PLAN.md`
     - `docs/AVM_NEON_MAPPING_PLAN.md`

8) **Tooling (modern compiler UX; self-hosting behind gates)** (M)
   - Keep Go bootstrap canonical until Oren-native tooling meets reliability/perf gates.
   - Track Oren-native tools as gated milestones: `fmt`, `test`, `pkg`, `lsp`.
   - References:
     - `docs/TEST_SYSTEM.md`
     - `docs/CLI_COMPLETION.md`
     - `docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`

9) **Tests & iteration speed (integration-first; backend/arch neutral by default)** (S)
   - Keep `make test` iteration-fast and deterministic.
   - Prefer a small number of high-signal integration suites + fixtures as living spec.
   - Reference: `docs/TEST_SYSTEM.md`

## P1 (Soon)

1) **Signed `.obc` + root trust (multiverse updates / “app store”)** (M)
   - Formalize cert chain constraints and root pubkey distribution/rotation.
   - Keep private keys out of repo (`../oren-ca/`).
   - References:
     - `docs/APPSTORE_ROOTCA_AND_UPDATES.md`
     - `docs/CERT_CHAIN_FORMAT.md`

2) **Stackless recursion beyond TCO (heap call frames)** (L)
   - For non-tail recursion that cannot be optimized by TCO, provide a deterministic heap-frame model (AVM-like).
   - Reference: `docs/STACK_SAFETY.md`
